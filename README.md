# Car-Leasing-Calculator
Front-end task for interview

This is a car leasing calculator. I made the layout using HTML and CSS. I made media query for the responsiveness of the page. After that I took all elemnts I need for the calculations and extracted them in js variables.
I made event listeners for which are fireing on every change. All of the calculations are extracted in calculateLeasingDetails function. 
I checked the data entered by the user and put a message to be displayed if there are incorrect data so that the user can enter correct data.
